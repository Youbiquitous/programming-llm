# Chapter 8 - Conversational UI (Agents)

The example application, built in Chapter 8, aims to explore the basics of a conversational UI pattern. To do this, we build a "conversational" API to book a room in a fake hotel.

As it's a .NET 8 API project, you must install the needed .NET SDK. Once this is done, to run the project, you just have to update the existing appsettings.json and appsettings-dev.json file with your Azure OpenAI API endpoint, apikey and deployment.
