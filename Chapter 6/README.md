# Chapter 6 - OPENAI SDK

The example application, built in Chapter 6, aims to explore the basic functionalities exposed by OPENAI official SDK.

As it's a .NET 8 ASP.NET project, you must install the needed SDK. Once this is done, to run the project, you just have to update the existing appsettings.json and appsettings-dev.json files with your Azure OpenAI API endpoint, apikey and deployment.
